### Part 1

> There is no starter code for this part since creating the app is part of the demo

Focus:
- Spinning up a new ReactJS/Vite app
- Removing boilerplate content to have a blank slate
- Creating some components for composing pages
- Adding temporary hard-coded content and structure with basic HTML
- Incorporating CSS & responsive layouts after content is in place
- Loop over lists with .map() to produce multiple instances of JSX or minor components
- Storing test data and passing data through props

> Use the `part1-solution-basics` branch to check my solution.

### Part 2

> Use the `part2-starter-state` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Implementing conditional rendering within JSX with ternary operators (`?` and `:`) and logical AND operator (`&&`)
- Utilizing the `useState()` hook for state variables that will trigger re-rendering if their values change
- Lifting state to parent
- Passing event handlers with props

> Use the `part2-solution-state` branch to check my solution.

### Part 3
> Use the `part3-starter-forms` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Managing form data with React
- Utilizing dynamic handlers

> Use the `part3-solution-forms` branch to check my solution.

### Part 4

> Use the `part4-starter-lifecycles` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Fetching data from an external API
- Tapping into component lifecycles with the `useEffect()` hook
- Manage race conditions when data is loading
- Handling errors with `try`/`catch`/`finally`
- Hooking into the DOM with useRef()

> Use the `part4-solution-lifecycles` branch to check my solution.

### Part 5

> Use the `part5-starter-routing` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Adding the React Router dependency
- Setting routes to define URLs and correlate components
- Implementing dynamic routing with path parameters and the `useParams()` hook
- Incorporating the `<Link>` component for sending users to other components based on routes
- Leveraging the `useNavigate()` hook for re-routing from a component (without the user clicking a link)
