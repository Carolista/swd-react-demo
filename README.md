# swd-react-demo

A simplified version of the front end React app for the art gallery demo that will be continued in Unit 2.

> Students: Fork and clone this to your local machine. Make sure you run the React project from the project folder, not the main repo folder.

### Part 1

This first section focuses on the following:
- Spinning up a new ReactJS/Vite app *(this is why there is no part 1 starter code branch, only a solution)*
- Removing boilerplate content to have a blank slate
- Creating some components for composing pages
- Adding temporary hard-coded content and structure with basic HTML
- Incorporating CSS & responsive layouts after content is in place

> Use the `part1-solution-getting-started` branch to check my solution.

### Part 2

> Use the `part2-starter-using-state` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Incorporating JavaScript to store test data, loop over lists, and produce multiple instances of JSX or minor components
- Implementing conditional rendering
- Utilizing the `useState()` hook for state variables that will trigger re-rendering if their values change
- Lifting state to top level
- Passing data from a parent to a child component with props

> Use the `part2-solution-using-state` branch to check my solution.

### Part 3

> Use the `part3-starter-routing` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Adding the React Router dependency
- Setting routes to define URLs and correlate components
- Implementing dynamic routing with path parameters and the `useParams()` hook
- Incorporating the `<Link>` component for sending users to other components based on routes

> Use the `part3-solution-routing` branch to check my solution.

### Part 4

> Use the `part4-starter-forms-and-fetching` branch to get started.

Focus:
- Managing form data with React
- Fetching data from an external API
- Tapping into component lifecycles with `useEffect()` hook to control race conditions with data loading
- Handling errors with try/catch/finally
- Leveraging the `useNavigate()` hook for re-routing from a component (without the user clicking a link)

> Use the `part4-solution-forms-and-fetching` branch to check my solution.
