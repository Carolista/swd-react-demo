/* 
    Most of my CSS files are organized by colocation,
    BUT I didn't want to have to import them into every 
    single file, so I have imported them here instead.

    It is important to observe order of precedence 
    by putting general CSS definitions first and then 
    putting the most specific definitions (which may
    override general definitions) last.

    NOTE ON RESPONSIVE DESIGN
    
    I have set my default styles for widths < 380px 
    (a few devices really are that small) and have used 
    media queries within the files imported above to set 
    definitions for larger screen widths on local selectors. 
    
    I have breakpoints at:
    380, 480, 768, 1024, 1200, 1366, and 1600

    It is not always necessary to finesse it that much!
    
    I did not use media queries for variable font sizes and 
    most margin and padding values, but instead used clamp() 
    to control min, preferred, and max values.
