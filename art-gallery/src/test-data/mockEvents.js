		subtitle: 'Opening Reception with Elias Vance',
		description:
			"Join us for the opening night celebration of The Concrete Forest, a striking new exhibition by St. Louis-based photographer Elias Vance. Vance's work captures the quiet beauty of urban decay and the resilience of nature pushing through the pavement of neighborhoods like The Grove and Cherokee Street. His large-scale, monochromatic prints explore themes of transition and history in the city. The evening will feature a meet-and-greet with the artist, complimentary light appetizers from a local caterer, and a cash bar featuring local St. Louis craft beer.",
		bio: "Elias Vance is a photographer and graphic designer born and raised in South City, St. Louis. He earned his BFA from Washington University in St. Louis and has spent the last decade documenting the textures and overlooked corners of his hometown. His work is heavily influenced by the architecture of Eads Bridge and the brutalist elements of St. Louis's post-war landscape.",
